# Audio-Driven-Face-Animation
This project will explore the creation of personalized talking head driven by an audio stimulus. I will capture a dataset of a person speaking, pre-process the data to make it suitable for deep learning based approaches, implement a neural netowrk to synthesize a  face model. Implementation: python, pytorch/keras
